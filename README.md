# NeuralSmoker
Control the fingerbot on your Home Assistant server using the Neurosity brain-computer interface by focusing on the switch.
Connect to the fingerbot with a Neurosity brain computer. In this case I use focus brainwaves to control a fingerbot through a Tuya HA integration. 

For fun and to reduce brain fog I created the worldâ€™s first neural smoker.
